# Simple Dapp using Web3 and Python

Goal of the repo was to create a simple dapp that will allow transactions through using Python. While building the application I was able to learn more about how to pull a contract built using remix IDE. The contract in this repo was a simple Greeter.sol contract built using Solidity.

Remix IDE: An IDE in which user build smart contracts with Solidity. Solidity is a programing language used to create Smart Contracts within Ethereum blockchain.
